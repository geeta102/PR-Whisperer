# PR Whisperer

PR Whisperer is a *prototype AI-powered code review assistant* designed to help developers who are coding *individually without access to senior reviewers*. The goal of PR Whisperer is to give developers the experience of a *senior-level code review in seconds* before they submit a pull request.

## Problem

Many developers — especially *students, solo developers, and junior engineers* — often build projects without mentorship or a proper code review process.

Some key challenges:

•⁠  ⁠Many developers ship code *without sufficient code review*
•⁠  ⁠Linters and static tools catch *syntax issues but not contextual problems*
•⁠  ⁠Developers frequently receive *vague feedback* or discover issues only after deployment

Without proper feedback:

•⁠  ⁠Security vulnerabilities may reach production
•⁠  ⁠Inefficient code patterns persist
•⁠  ⁠Learning and growth slow down

PR Whisperer attempts to address this gap by acting as an *AI senior reviewer for individual developers*.


## Solution Overview

Paste your git diff or changed code and get instant feedback across four dimensions:
- **Security** — detects SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, insecure patterns
- **Performance** — flags inefficient loops, N+1 queries, memory issues
- **Readability** — reviews naming, complexity, comment quality
- **Convention** — checks best practices like DRY, SOLID principles

Each issue comes with a **Before/After inline fix** and a **PR Readiness Score (0–100)**.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Backend: Python FastAPI + Uvicorn
- AI Model: LLaMA 3.3-70B via Groq API
- Protocol: REST/JSON

## Current Limitations

Since this is an early prototype, some features are not yet implemented:

•⁠  ⁠GitHub PR auto-fetch integration
•⁠  ⁠VS Code extension
•⁠  ⁠User authentication
•⁠  ⁠Review history storage
•⁠  ⁠Team analytics or dashboards


## Future Improvements

Planned future iterations may include:

•⁠  ⁠VS Code extension integration
•⁠  ⁠GitHub API support to automatically fetch PR diffs
•⁠  ⁠CI integration for automatic PR review
•⁠  ⁠Team dashboards for analytics and coding standards
•⁠  ⁠Improved AI models and infrastructure


## Project Status

PR Whisperer is currently a *prototype built to demonstrate the concept of AI-assisted pull request reviews for individual developers*.

It focuses on showcasing how AI can provide *structured feedback and actionable fixes* before code is submitted for review.
